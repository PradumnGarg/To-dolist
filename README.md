# To-dolist

This project was built on node JS,mongo DB and EJS templates were also used alongside. Dynamic routes were used to create pages on the fly. The landing page is the grocery page 
which is used my family to keep track of daily necessities(SO try not to update the listðŸ˜…). By passing parameters user will be able to create lists on the fly and update the same
when required.
